# Project Learning Log

This repository contains a daily learning journal documenting my work on a hands-on software engineering project.

## Purpose
- Track technical decisions and trade-offs
- Capture lessons learned during implementation
- Build a clear record of problem-solving and system thinking
- Create a reference for future projects and interviews

## Format
Each day includes:
- What I worked on
- What I learned
- Design decisions made
- Open questions or follow-ups

This is not polished tutorial content — it is an honest engineering log written during real development.

## Tech Stack (example)
- Java / Spring Boot
- SQL / PostgreSQL / Oracle
- Kafka
- Docker
- AWS

## Why this exists
I learn best by building. This log helps me:
- Think clearly
- Improve decision-making
- Communicate technical reasoning
